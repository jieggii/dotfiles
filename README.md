# Dotfiles for my Huawei Matebook 14 AMD 2021
I use i3wm and arch linux for this setup

I've bought this laptop without any necessary research about linux support, so there are some issues:
* I have no sound
* Mic doesn't probably work too but I've heard that there are some workarounds for that
* Fingerprint auth does not work too

Other things are mostly ok
