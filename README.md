I use i3wm and arch linux for this setup.

I've bought this laptop without any necessary research about linux support, so there are some issues:
* I have no sound ([thread about that](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/issues/3249))
* Mic doesn't work, but I've heard, that there are some workarounds for that
* Fingerprint auth does not work

Other things are mostly ok.
